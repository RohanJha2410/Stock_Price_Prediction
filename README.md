A Deep Learning-based **Time Series Forecasting** project that predicts future stock prices using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of sequence modeling, data preprocessing, and real-time forecasting with an interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Stock price movement is a complex time-series problem influenced by trends, seasonality, and volatility.

This project:

- 📊 Analyzes historical stock data  
- 🔄 Preprocesses and scales time-series sequences  
- 🧠 Trains an LSTM deep learning model  
- 📈 Forecasts the next 30 days of stock prices  
- 🌐 Deploys predictions using Streamlit  

The goal is to explore how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM, can capture long-term dependencies in financial data.

🧠 Model Architecture

The model consists of:

🔹 LSTM Layer(s) for capturing sequential dependencies

🔹 Dense Layer for final output prediction

🔹 MinMaxScaler for feature normalization

LSTM is ideal for:

- Time-series forecasting

- Sequential pattern recognition

- Long-term trend analysis

📊 Features

✔️ Historical stock price visualization
✔️ 30-day future stock price forecast
✔️ Interactive Plotly charts
✔️ Dark-themed UI
✔️ Pre-trained model for instant predictions
✔️ Scaler persistence for consistent preprocessing


📉 Model Evaluation

Evaluation methods include:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)



🔮 Future Improvements

- Add GRU model comparison
